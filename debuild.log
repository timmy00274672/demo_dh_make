I: helloworld: hardening-no-pie bin/hello
N:
N:    This package provides an ELF executable that was not compiled as a
N:    position independent executable (PIE).
N:
N:    PIE is required for fully enabling Address Space Layout Randomization
N:    (ASLR), which makes "Return-oriented" attacks more difficult.
N:
N:    Historically, PIE has been associated with noticeable performance
N:    overhead on i386. However, GCC-5 has implemented an optimization that
N:    can reduce the overhead significantly.
N:
N:    If you use dpkg-buildflags, you may have to add hardening=+pie or
N:    hardening=+all to DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.
N:
N:    The relevant compiler flags must be passed both to the compiler and the
N:    linker (e.g. for C that would be commonly be CFLAGS and LDFLAGS).
N:
N:    CAVEAT: Please keep in mind that the PIE flag (-fPIE) is not suitable
N:    for all cases:
N:
N:     * It is <not> compatible with -fPIC which required for
N:       compiling shared libraries.
N:     * It is unlikely to work when compiling static libraries or
N:       executables (gcc -static).
N:
N:    If your upstream build compiles either of the above, you may have to
N:    patch the build to ensure that only ELF executables are compiled with
N:    PIE.
N:
N:    Refer to https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening,
N:    https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html, and

I: helloworld: hardening-no-bindnow bin/hello

N:    This package provides an ELF binary that lacks the "bindnow" linker
N:    flag.
N:
N:    If the ELF binary does not rely on late binding of symbols (e.g. weak
N:    symbols), then please consider enabling this feature. Otherwise, please
N:    consider overriding the tag (possibly with a comment about why).
N:
N:    If you use dpkg-buildflags, you may have to add hardening=+bindnow or
N:    hardening=+all to DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.
